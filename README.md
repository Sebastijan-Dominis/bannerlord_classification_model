# bannerlord_classification_model
This project was made as a part of a university course called "Neural networks and deep learning" at the Faculty of informatics Pula. Within it was created a classification model for six of the basic troops from the main six factions of a video game Mount&amp;Blade II: Bannerlord. The dataset was created personally, and can be accessed here.
